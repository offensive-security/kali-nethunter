This is a binary distribution for PHP 5.3.8 / Lighttpd 1.4.29.
The bundle does not include all modules that come with PHP or Lighttpd, since some of those modules depend 
on libraries not available on uclibc / Bionic. All modules are statically linked into the executables.

The binary file of PHP is distributed under PHP License (which you find below at point L.1)
The binary file of Lighttpd is offered under Lighttpd licence (which is also below at point L.2). 

All other scripts / source code bundled have the New BSD License:
